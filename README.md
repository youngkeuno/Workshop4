# Workshop4
 This workshop has a function that makes a circle move in a direction the user dictates where “w” is up, “s” is down, “d” is right, and “a” is left. The circle will stop when it hits the edge of the window. The last function is basically a game where the user controls a circle using the same keys as before. The user tries making its circle touch the red moving circle. Every time it’s touched the user gets a point which should appear written in the terminal.
